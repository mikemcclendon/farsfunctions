The package contains five functions. However, 3 are of primary use for interrogating data. Those will be explained below. Please note: package assumes FARS data files in the standard format and naming convention are available in the user's working directory.\n\n## fars_summarize_years\nThis function returns a monthly summary of incidents. It takes a year in the form of an integer or string as an argument and then uses that value to read in a CSV as a tbl_df for data of that given year and and returns a monthly summary of the observations. Usage below.\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(farsfunctions)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n```{r}\nfars_summarize_years('2013')\n```\n## fars_read_years\nThis function returns the month and year corresponding to each FARS observation. It takes a year in the form of an integer or string as an argument and then uses that value to read in a CSV as a tbl_df for data of that given year and returns the month and year corresponding to each observation. \n\n```{r}\nfars_read_years('2013')\n```\n\n## fars_map_state\nReturn a map plot of incidents. This is a function that takes a state number and year in the form of an integer or string as an argument and then uses that value to generate a map plot of observations for that state and year.\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\nlibrary(farsfunctions)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(maps)\n```\n```{r}\nfars_map_state(21, 2013)\n```\n",
